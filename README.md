# multisim-mk

Simple support for driving VHDL simulators from makefiles.

To get started:
1. Add multisim-mk to your repo as a submodule.
2. Copy the template makefile to your build directory and edit it as required for your design.

When invoking make, the simulator must be specified (as a make target):

    make <simulator>

Supported simulators are listed below:

| \<simulator\> | Description     |
|---------------|-----------------|
| ghdl          | GHDL            |
| nvc           | NVC             |
| msq           | ModelSim/Questa |
| vivado        | Vivado          |

When used with Vivado, multisim-mk depends on xilinx-mk, so you will need to add this as another submodule to your repo.
