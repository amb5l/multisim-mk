# multisim-mk

Simple support for driving VHDL simulators from makefiles.

To get started:
1. Add multisim-mk to your repo as a submodule.
2. Copy the template makefile to your build directory and edit it to add your design units, sources, and dependancies.

When invoking make, the simulator must be specified (as a make target) as follows:

    make <simulator>

Supported simulators are listed below:

| \<simulator\> | Description                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| ghdl          | GHDL                           |
| nvc           | NVC                            |
| gen           | Generic (Questa, ModelSim etc) |
